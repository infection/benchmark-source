# Benchmark Source

This repository aims at providing a codebase with sufficient source code and
tests to be used for benchmarking or profiling purposes for Infection.

To generate the coverage data:

```shell
make
```

Code placed under the `AutoGenerated` is auto-generated with the following
command:

```shell
make generate_code
```

Hence, it should not be manually modified.
